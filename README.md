## Project definition

### Background

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, is characterized by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Currently, 5% of the child and adolescent population Argentina live with this condition. It is still diagnosed using subjective clinical criteria, which are often difficult to evaluate. However, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques hold potential for identifying neuroimaging biomarkers that could facilitate the diagnosis. Our objective is to develop machine learning classification models to detect ADHD through the analysis of resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) signals.

### Tools we learned during this project

### Data

**ADHD-200 Preprocessed Sample:**

*Pierre Bellec, Carlton Chu, François Chouinard-Decorte, Yassine Benhajali, Daniel S. Margulies, R. Cameron Craddock (2017). The Neuro Bureau ADHD-200 Preprocessed repository. NeuroImage, 144, Part B, pp. 275 - 286. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.06.034*

Prepared by the collaboration of 8 international neuroimaging institutes, who held a competition in 2011, to identify ADHD biomarkers.

Composition:
* 947 children and adolescents
* 362 diagnosed with ADHD
* 585 typically developing controls

In order to make the competition accessible to a broader range of researchers, the data was preprocessed and shared by the Preprocessed Connectomes Project (PCP), what resulted in several publications, MS theses, PhD dissertations and even patents.

### Project steps

1. We downloaded the preprocessed ADHD-200 Sample dataset using a script that allowed us to obtain time series parcelled according to the AAL atlas, which has 116 ROIs.
2. We started by creating our Jupyter Notebook, loading the BOLD signal data for a single subject and visualizing the time signals in the 116 ROIs using Matplotlib.
3. With this subject's data, we constructed a Pearson correlation matrix between ROIs using the "corrcoef()" function from NumPy.
4. To visualize the correlation matrix, which in this case would be a connectivity matrix, we used Matplotlib and the "heatmap" function from Seaborn.
5. Then we used the "tril()" function from NumPy to retain only the lower triangle of the matrix, avoiding repeated data and the diagonal that do not provide information for our case study.
6. Using the "tril_indices()" method, we created a list or vector that contains the indices of our matrix.
      This method orders rows-wise from the lower triangular matrix. Specifically, the order follows:
        All elements from the first row below the diagonal.
        All elements from the second row below the diagonal.
        And so on, up to the last row.
7. Once we understood the process for a single subject, we were ready to replicate it for each of the subjects included in our dataset. For this, we used for loops, if-else conditionals, and try-except exception handling.
  For example, to iterate through the downloaded files following the phenotype subject list, avoiding errors in case the file did not exist or had any error that prevented the correct creation of our matrix.
8. The result obtained from the previous iteration was a matrix with 6670 features (PC of ROIn x ROIm) and 820 rows, the considered subjects. We converted this vector matrix into a DataFrame using Pandas.
9. As we had the subjects' IDs and their diagnosis in the phenotype, we could add them to our DataFrame.
10. From this point, we could separate our data into Train and Test sets using train_test_split from the sklearn library:
    a. test_size=0.2
    b. random_state=42
    c. stratify=target
11. Our problem: Supervised Classification Model with a Binary Target Variable.
    First approach: initially, we tried several models, including:
      a. PCA (Principal Components Analysis)
      b. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
      c. Logistic Regression
      d. XGBoost
12. As our classification was binary, we used the following metrics to evaluate our models obtained from sklearn.metrics:
    a. Train and Test Accuracy
    b. Confusion Matrix
    c. ROC AUC
    d. Additionally, we used the Classification Report, which includes several metrics.
13. Since we got the best results with XGBoost, we focused on optimizing the hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV in order to reduce the overfitting.
14. We combined PCA and XGBoost but did not get better results.
15. Finally we used Feature Importance from XGBoost to compare the most important features for the model with the theory about ADHD diagnosis.
16. With all the knowledge gained during this workshop, and building this project, we prepare a conclusion, a presentation and this markdowm.

**Time Series:**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fcovelli/project-readme/main/BOLD%20intensity.png" alt="Cover Image" width="400"/>

Each time series represents the intensity of the BOLD signal of every ROI (Region of Interest)
along the rs-fRMI.

**Connectivity Matrix:**

In order to create a connectivity matrix, we evaluated the Pearson Correlation between each of these signals.

**Feature Importance Interpretation**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fcovelli/project-readme/main/feature_importance2.jpeg" alt="feature importance" width="600"/>

* Temporal Pole and Frontal regions appear to be recurrently significant in feature importance, suggesting a key role in ADHD.
* The Cingulum also appears repeatedly, indicating its relevance in connectivity differences for ADHD.
* The Amygdala connectivity to the Cingulum (both Left and Right) highlights potential emotional regulation and cognitive control variations in ADHD.

The importance values are relatively close, ranging approximately from 0.004 to 0.006. This indicates that while some connections are slightly more influential, many features are comparably important in distinguishing ADHD from controls in resting-state fMRI. These identified ROIs and their connectivity patterns could be further studied to develop diagnostic methods.

## Conclusion and acknowledgement

We can conclude that with an accuracy of 0.658, there is significant room for improvement in ADHD diagnosis based on classification models.

Our best metrics are achieved using XGBoost with Hyperparameters Optimization and Cross-Validation using RandomizedSearchCV:
  ACC = 0.658

Despite PCA helped us to reduce the dimensionality of our features, when combined with XGBoost the perfomance was lower:
  ACC = 0.628

The identified ROIs and their connectivity patterns could be further studied to develop diagnostic methods.There are many ways to expand and improve this project, and we are excited to explore them.

Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to our teaching assistants from Humai, Buenos Aires, who have supported us from day one and generously shared their diverse expertise in neuroscience and computer science.
